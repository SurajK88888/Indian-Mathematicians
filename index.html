                    Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant mathematician who gets credited even today for his contributions
                    in the field of
                    mathematics. <br /> <br /> Born in the year 1887 in Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan was an exceptionally
                    brilliant
                    child who
                    would outshine
                    other children of his age in solving equations. The circumstances of his family were not good and
                    they lived in poverty
                    for most part of their lives, thereby not giving the young Ramanujan an opportunity to pursue his
                    passion-mathematics-due to lack of proper resources.<br /> <br />
                    However the laborious Ramanujan found his inspiration in the book 'Synopsis of elementary results in
                    pure mathematics'
                    by George S. Carr. A brilliant mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan is credited today for his
                    contributions in the field
                    of mathematics.<br /> <br /> It was due to sheer strength of determination and devotion that the
                    immensely
                    talented mathematician
                    could invent some of the most crucial equations for the field of mathematical studies- game theory
                    and infinite series.
                    The infinite series for π is used in arithmetical calculations even today.<br /> <br /> The year
                    1914 was the
                    turning point in the
                    struggling life the genius mathematician. He was invited to Cambridge by the very eminent
                    mathematician, G.H.Hardy.
                    Hardy after going through Ramanujan's papers was perplexed by the geniousness of his work. The
                    papers that the young
                    mind had brought along, from home to Cambridge, were written between the years 1903-14. While some
                    equations had already
                    been discovered, the remainder were entirely new for even G.H.Hardy. He was amazed at Ramanujan's
                    insight into
                    algebraical formulae, transformations of infinite series, etc. In the year 1916, he was awarded his
                    Ph.D. by the
                    university. <br /> <br />The story of this mathematical genius is truly inspiring as Ramanujan had
                    to practice in
                    circumstances that
                    didn't even let him afford enough papers to practice the equations. A slate and chalk were his most
                    trusted aids. At a
                    very young age, Ramanuj bid goodbye to the world in the year 1920 due to the dreaded disease,
                    Tuberculosis.

                    Brahmagupta was a seventh century Indian mathematician and astronomer, best known for his book
                    'Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta'.
                    The book was the first text that treated zero as a number and gave references for using it in
                    calculations.
                    <br /> <br /> Born in the state of Rajasthan, most of his works were in the Sanskrit language, which
                    was the prominent language then.
                    Known also as Bhillamalacarya, the genius mathematician made immense contribution in the field of
                    Arithmetic by not only
                    explaining how to calculate cube and the cube-root of an integer but also providing rules for
                    computation of square and
                    square root.<br /> <br />
                    Brahmagupta could not complete the use of zero in calculations relating to division but he offered
                    other calculations,
                    such as (1 + 0 = 1; 1 - 0 = 1; and 1 x 0 =0), for using the digit zero.<br /> <br /> Interestingly,
                    previously calculations such as 3-4 entailed the answer called meaningless. Brahmagupta gave such
                    calculations a meaning by inventing the concept of negative numbers.<br /> <br />Brahmagupta made
                    immense contributions in the field of geometry and trigonometry by establishing √10 (3.162277) as an
                    approximation for π (3.141593). The other contributions of the accomplished mathematician were the
                    Brahmagupta's Formula
                    and Brahmagupta's Theorem. The former provided a formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral
                    while the latter related
                    to the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral.

                    Bhaskara I (c.600 CE-680) was a seventh century Indian mathematician and astronomer credited with
                    the invention of Hindu
                    decimal system. Born in Maharashtra,
                    <br /> <br /> Bhaskara's commentary Aryabhatiyabhasya, written in 629 CE, is the oldest known work,
                    in Sanskrit language, on
                    mathematics and astronomy. He was a follower of Aryabhat.<br /> <br />
                    His most notable books were Laghubhāskarīya and Mahabhaskariya
                    <br /> <br /> The latter book, divided into eight chapters, dwells into mathematical astronomy. The
                    book is also credited to have
                    given the approximation formula for sin x. Relations between sine and cosine, and also between the
                    sine of an angle >90°
                    >180° or >270° to the sine of an angle smaller than 90° have been given in this book.<br />
                    <br />The book also discusses about longitudes of the planets, conjunctions of the planets with each
                    other and with bright stars, eclipses of the sun and the moon, risings and settings, and the lunar
                    crescent. Bhaskara I is also known for the Pell Equation ( 8x² + 1 = y² ).<br /><br />Not much is
                    known about Bhaskara I except that he was born in Parbhani, Maharashtra and died in Andhra Pradesh.
                    He is
                    called Bhaskara I to distinguish from another 12th century mathematician of the same name. It is
                    believed that Bhaskara
                    I's father was his earliest teacher and the book, Laghubhāskarīya, is an abridged version of his
                    earlier book,
                    Aryabhatiyabhasya. However Bhaskara I along with Brahmagupta is considered to be the greatest
                    ancient Indian
                    mathematicians of all time.

                    Shakuntala Devi was a remarkable lady known for superfast calculations, something that had earned
                    her the title of
                    'human computer'.<br /><br /> Born in Bangalore in the year 1929, Shakuntala's talent was first
                    observed by her father when he was
                    training her for remembering numbers on the card for the circuses. Shakuntala's father used to work
                    in a circus. Soon
                    after the father - daughter duo were traveling to do street shows based on a young Shakuntala's
                    calculations' talent.<br /><br />
                    Shakuntala had by the end of year 1944 moved to London thereby traveling across the world doing
                    shows. After all the
                    young prodigy was known to solve the most complex equations within seconds. So much so that the
                    professor of psychology
                    at California University, Arthur Jensen, had called her to the university in the year 1988 to study
                    her exceptional
                    capabilities. <br /><br />The world was stunned with Shakuntala Devi's talent. In the year 1980, her
                    name was
                    recorded in the
                    Guinness Book of World Record for calculating thirteen digit numbers- 7,686,369,774,870 ×
                    2,465,099,745,779- which were
                    picked at random at the Computer Department of Imperial College, London. She gave the correct answer
                    –
                    18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730- in just 28 seconds.<br /><br /> Shakuntala Devi was also a
                    successful
                    astrologer and author of
                    several books on the subject. She also wrote texts on mathematics for children and puzzles. The
                    immensely gifted
                    mathematician bid her adieu to the world in year 2013.

                    Famously also called Aryabhata I (476-550 CE) or Aryabhata The Elder, in order to distinguish him
                    from another tenth
                    century mathematician of the same name, Aryabhata flourished in Patliputra during Gupta
                    dynasty.<br /><br /> Aryabhata was a
                    Scientist, Mathematician as well as an Astronomer. This is so because not only had he discovered
                    that the Earth is
                    spherical, which revolves around the Sun but also that the number of days in a year is
                    365.<br /><br /> The two most prominent works
                    composed by Aryabhata are Aryabhatiya and the Aryabhatasiddhanta.<br /><br /> The latter is a lost
                    work now while Aryabhatiya was
                    divided into three sections- Ganita (Mathematics), Kala-kriya (Time Calculations), and Gola
                    (Sphere).<br /><br /> In Ganita,
                    Aryabhata has named the first 10 decimal places and given algorithms for obtaining the square and
                    cubic roots by using
                    the decimal number system. Aryabhata had also developed using one of the two methods for creating
                    the table of sines by
                    using Pythagorean theorem. He also realized that second-order sine difference is proportional to
                    sine. <br /><br />In Kala-kriya
                    Aryabhata discusses about astronomy such as planetary motions, definitions of various units of time,
                    etc.<br /><br /> In Gola,
                    Aryabhata has applied trigonometry to spherical geometry. This also became the apparent basis for
                    prediction of solar
                    and lunar eclipse. The equation in Gola was used by Aryabhata to explain that the rotation of the
                    Earth about its axis
                    was the reason for westward motion of the stars. He also referred to reflections from the Sun for
                    luminosity of the Moon
                    and the planets.

                    Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao, considered the doyen of Indian Statistics, has works that have
                    influenced various fields
                    from economics to demography to medicine.<br /><br /> Born in 1879 in Karnataka, Rao had developed
                    interest in
                    the subject
                    mathematics from a very early age. Evident as this is from his earlier account narrating how his
                    father brought for him
                    to solve a book titled 'Problems for Leelavathi' that contained questions by a mathematician for his
                    daughter Leelavathi
                    to solve. He explains how his father would motivate the then eleven years old Rao to try solving
                    five to ten problems
                    every day.<br /><br /> Rao had always keen interest in the subject and this is the reason why he
                    could win for
                    himself the
                    Chandrasekara Iyer Scholarship for both the years at intermediate level. Even M.A, he graduated with
                    first class honours
                    from Andhra University in the year 1940. However it was his year at the Indian Statistical Institute
                    that proved to be a
                    turning point in the life of young Roy. Here he got to publish six papers, jointly (with top
                    researcher K.R. Nair) as
                    well as indepently in the year 1941.<br /><br /> C.R. Rao received gold medal and a first class M.A.
                    degree in
                    Statistics from the
                    Indian Statistical Institute (Kolkata) in the year 1943. Rao' work focussed on four areas-
                    multivariate analysis, linear
                    model, designs in experiments, characterisation of probability distributions- and this focus
                    continued to be his area of
                    specialisation for the rest of his career.<br /><br /> Rao has made important contributions to
                    combinatorial
                    mathematics and a
                    number of technical terms in statistics such as Cramér-Rao Inequality or Bound (CRB), Rao-Blackwell
                    Theorem, Fisher-Rao
                    Metric, and Rao Distance have been named after him.<br /><br /> Rao score test was also created by
                    hi as an
                    alternative to Pearson’s
                    chi-squared test and Wald’s test. C.R. Rao was also instrumental in introducing the concept of
                    ‘quadratic entropy’ — a
                    diversity measure, which could be used to carry out an analysis of diversity of any
                    order.<br /><br /> C.R. Rao
                    under the guidance
                    of his mentor P.C. Mahalanobis has contributed to the establishment of statistical bureaus across
                    India. He was
                    conferred the Padma Vibhushan by the Government of India in the year 2001, and the National Medal of
                    Science by
                    President George W Bush in 2002. Aside from the various other awards, the legendary C.R. Rao has
                    been has been awarded
                    thirty-three honorary degrees by universities in eighteen countries if the world.

                    Chakravarthi Padmanabhan Ramanujam was a gifted Indian mathematician, known for his works on number
                    theory and algebraic
                    geometry.<br /><br /> Born in the year 1938 in Madras (now Chennai), Ramanujan joined the
                    prestigious Loyola college in Madras (now
                    Chennai) for finishing intermediate and college studies after finishing his high school in the year
                    1952. <br /><br />C.P. Ramanujan
                    is well known for his rejection of promotion to the position of an Associate Professor at Tata
                    Institute of Fundamental
                    Research (TIFR), Mumbai. Believing this elevation to a higher position to be undeserving in nature,
                    he later accepted
                    this post after persuasions by several of his friends and colleagues.<br /><br /> Passionate about
                    the subject mathematics, the
                    young Ramanujan was appreciated well by his doctoral supervisor for in-depth knowledge of the
                    subject.<br /><br /> Ramanujan's
                    personal library had books based in other languages as he was trying to teach himself other
                    languages such as French,
                    German, Russian and Italian to study mathematics in their original forms.<br /><br /> During his
                    stint as a professor at TIFR,
                    Ramanujan published his first two papers in the year 1963, on Waring’s problem for algebraic number
                    fields. The second
                    paper was based on the algebraic half of Siegel’s problem. The paper provided such results that had
                    never been proved.
                    The brilliant mathematician also received great praises for preparing lecture notes, for highly
                    established
                    mathematicians, that were to be imparted as notes for various courses at TIFR, Mumbai.<br /><br />
                    Ramanujam had also made
                    significant contributions in the field of algebraic geometry, especially providing clarification on
                    the Kodaira
                    Vanishing Theorem.<br /><br /> Ramanujan had made remarkable contributions in the field of
                    mathematics and these were well
                    appreciated by the international community. However just like S.Ramanujan, C.P. Ramanujan died very
                    early at the young
                    age of only 37. Immediately after his death, a commemorative hall was named after him in the
                    Institute of Mathematics at
                    the University of Genoa.

                    P.C. Mahalanobis was an Indian Mathematician, Statistician and Scientist. Not only is he considered
                    the father of
                    Statistics in India but also the hand behind the establishment of Indian Statistical Institute (ISI)
                    in India in the
                    year 1931. He was also instrumental in shaping up of the Planning Commission of India.<br /><br />
                    Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was
                    born in Kolkata in the year 1893. After completing his school education, he received his B.Sc in
                    Physics from Presidency
                    College, Kolkata. Later he went to Cambridge for further studies in Mathematics and Physics.
                    <br /><br />Mahalanobis is best known
                    for his Mahalanobis Distance or D2-statistic- measure of comparison between two different data sets.
                    In simple words, it
                    is a measurement used for studies in population distribution. <br /><br />Indian Statistical
                    Institute (ISI) credits all the major
                    statistical work done up till the 1930s to P.C.Mahalanobis. Many findings of his early studies were
                    of great impact for
                    agricultural development and control of floods.<br /><br /> For Mahalanobis, statistics was a kind
                    of new technology that aided
                    greatly in increasing the efficiency of human effort. The sixty years of flood data, in Odisha, so
                    analysed and
                    published by him in 1926, laid the foundation for installation of Hirakud dam on Mahanadi river,
                    some three decades
                    later.<br /><br /> So great was the influence of his work that not only Statistics was soon
                    recognised as a key discipline but also
                    students majoring in Physics had begun to take interest in Statistics.

                    Satyendra Nath Bose was an Indian physicist and mathematician, known most famously for Bose-Einstein
                    Condensate. Bose
                    had worked directly with Albert Einstein for this project. A certain type of particle named 'boson'
                    or the 'God
                    Particle' was assigned to Bose in recognition of the contributions made by Bose. Bose is therefore
                    often referred to as
                    “The Father of the God Particle”.<br /><br /> Born in the year 1894 in Kolkata, Bose had always been
                    an
                    intelligent child excelling
                    in education at every turn. By the years 1913 and 1915 respectively, he had finished his B.Sc and
                    M.Sc in Mathematics
                    while also at the same time outperforming his other classmates.<br /><br /> S.N.Bose enrolled
                    himself at the
                    University College of
                    Science in the year 1917 for further studies. It is during his tenure as a student there that Bose
                    got to study theories
                    of Statistical Mechanics by American mathematician J.Willard Gibbs and theory of relativity by
                    Albert Einstein. Bose in
                    collaboration with another bright fellow from his batch started translating the works of Einstein
                    into English from
                    German and French languages. This of course only after getting permission from Einstein.
                    <br /><br />The year
                    1924 can be considered
                    the biggest breakthrough for Bose's career. During this year was published a paper in which Bose had
                    derived Planck’s
                    'quantum radiation law' without making any reference to the classical theories of physics. This work
                    got all the more
                    importance because Planck’s law had yet not been proved. This paper was submitted by Bose to
                    Einstein for a review.
                    Einstein was impressed with Bose's research. A translated copy of the research, in German language,
                    was submitted to the
                    European Physics Journal by Einstein himself along with a letter of personal recommendation.
                    Einstein soon used the
                    basic concept by Bose for further research into the field of material physics.<br /><br /> Further
                    research by
                    Peter Higgs and
                    Francois Englert, in the field of God particle so clearly set by Bose, led them to winning the Nobel
                    Prize in physics in
                    the year 2013. Though Bose was never awarded this honour, many noted scientists believe Bose rightly
                    deserved the award.<br /><br />
                    From the years 1927, when Bose was made the head of the physics department in University of Kolkata,
                    till 1945 Bose was
                    working in his field of expertise. During later years Bose moved towards literature, philosophy and
                    Indian independence
                    movement.<br /><br /> Bose had received not only Padma Vibhushan for his notable works but also been
                    appointed
                    for various
                    prestigious positions at different universities. For instance, being an adviser to the Council of
                    Scientific and
                    Industrial Research or the presidentship of Indian Physical Society and the National Institute of
                    Science. He was also
                    awarded the fellowship for the Royal Society in London in 1958. Satyendra Nath Bose died in the year
                    1974.

                    state of Southern
                    India.<br /><br /> Mahavira made significant contributions in the field of algebra. The book written
                    by him,
                    Ganitasarasangraha, is
                    composed of mathematical procedures such as basic operations, reductions of fractions, miscellaneous
                    problems involving
                    a linear or quadratic equation with one unknown, the rule of three (involving proportionality),

                    Muir Central College (Allahabad). In the year 1923, he went to Kolkata to occupy the chair of
                    Hardinge Professor of
                    Mathematics. He was also elected the president of Calcutta Mathematical Society in 1924 and
                    vice-president of Indian
                    Association for the Advancement of Science, Kolkata. He held both these offices till his last. Dr
                    Ganesh Prasad was also
                    the founder member of National Institute of Sciences, India (which is now Indian National Science
                    Academy). He was also
                    one of the founders of the Agra University. Dr Prasad died in the year 1935.

                    C.S. Seshadri is an eminent mathematician, known for the Seshadri Constant (named after him). The
                    well known Indian
                    mathematician was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the year 2009 for his outstanding contributions in
                    the field of
                    mathematics.<br /><br /> Born in the year 1932, Chennai, Seshadri completed his graduation in the
                    subject
                    Mathematics in the year
                    1953, from Madras University before attending Bombay (now Mumbai) University for a Ph.D in the
                    subject. He completed his
                    doctorate in the year 1958 and later on got elected as a fellow at the Indian Academy of Sciences in
                    1971. From the
                    years 1953-1984, Seshadri also worked as a research scholar and senior professor, in the later
                    years, at Tata Institute
                    of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.<br /><br /> C.S. Seshadri's area of specialisation is
                    algebraic
                    geometry. The
                    Narasimhan–Seshadri theorem, created in collaboration with M.S. Narsimhan, has held a great
                    influence in the field of
                    mathematical studies. Equally well recognised are his works on the Geometric Invariant Theory,
                    Schubert Varieties, and
                    Standard Monomial Theory.<br /><br /> Seshadri, from the years 1957-1960, was sent to France by
                    TIFR, Mumbai.
                    There he was quite
                    fascinated by French tastes in not just wine and cuisine but also mathematics. Influenced greatly by
                    mathematical
                    geniuses such as Chevalley, Cartan, Schwartz, Grothendieck and Serre, Seshadri returned to India
                    only to become one of
                    the pioneers for starting the School of Mathematics, Tata Institute.<br /><br /> In a career
                    spanning around
                    five decades, C.S.
                    Seshadri has been not only an inspiring teacher for many but also a leader of a whole generation of
                    mathematicians. His
                    contributions have been considered highly critical for development of Moduli problems, Geometric
                    Invariant Theory as
                    well as Representation Theory of Algebraic Groups. The widely acclaimed mathematician is also the
                    recipient of several
                    prestigious awards such as TWAS Science Award, Honorary D.Sc. from Banaras Hindu University, Shanti
                    Swarup Bhatnagar
                    Award, Fellow of IAS, INSA and a Fellow of the Royal Society, Honorary degree, Université Pierre et
                    Marie Curie (UPMC),
                    Paris, Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, Srinivasa Ramanujan Medal from the Indian
                    Academy of Sciences, etc.

                <p class="text_area">
                    Radhanath Sikdar is most famously known for his calculation of the height of Mt Everest. He was one
                    of the first two
                    Indians to read Newton’s Principia (the other Indian was Rajnarayan Basak). By the year 1932, the
                    talented mathematician
                    had studied Euclid’s Elements, Jephson’s Fluxion and Analytical Geometry and Astronomy by
                    Windhouse.<br /><br /> Born in Kolkata in
                    the year 1813, Sikdar's first job was conducting geodetic surveys under the then Surveyor General of
                    India, George
                    Everest. He got this job in the year 1931 at the Great Trigonometric Survey.<br /><br /> By the year
                    1852,
                    Sikdar had started
                    working at the Dehradun headquarters under the student of George Everest, Colonel Andrew Waugh. Here
                    Sikdar was tasked
                    with calculating the height of different peaks for different mountains in the Himalayas. How
                    Radhanath Sikdar came
                    across this reading for the highest peak is interesting. Till date Kanchenjunga was considered the
                    highest peak but a
                    study by James Nicolson had concluded that there might be a higher peak, called the peak XV. This
                    study however had to
                    be left midway as Nicolson contracted malaria. <br /><br />Sikdar basing his readings on the above
                    calculations
                    calculated the
                    distance of peak XV. It is said that when he found out the measurements, he burst into Waugh's
                    office exclaiming, "Sir,
                    I have discovered the highest mountain in the world."<br /><br /> The peak was later on named Mt
                    Everest and the
                    height, 29002 ft,
                    so calculated by Radhanath Sikdar, was the official height till the year 1955 in India, before an
                    Indian survey
                    recalculated it to 29,092 ft.<br /><br /> George Everest had retired in the year 1843, but the
                    letter he wrote
                    to Radhanath's father
                    back then in appreciation of his work was testimony to the brilliance and unique capabilities of the
                    young Bengali
                    mathematician.

                    Dattathreya Ramchandra Kaprekar (1905–1986), also known as 'Ganitananda', was a recreational
                    mathematician. After
                    receiving his education from a school in Thane and later from Fergusson College in Pune, Kaprekar,
                    in the year 1927, won
                    the Wrangler R. P. Paranjpe Mathematical Prize for an original piece of work in
                    mathematics.<br /><br /> Though
                    he had received,
                    from the University of Mumbai, his bachelor's degree in the year 1929, yet Kaprekar he could never
                    get any postgraduate
                    training in the subject for himself. He was a teacher at a school on Nashik (Maharashtra), and had
                    worked tirelessly to
                    publish extensively on topics such as recurring decimals, magic squares, and integers with special
                    properties.<br /><br /> Due to
                    his extensive publications he had become a well known in the recreational mathematics
                    circles.<br /><br /> He
                    had described in his
                    works several classes of natural numbers as well as the Kaprekar, Harshad and Self numbers. The
                    Kaprekar constant, named
                    after him, was also discovered by Kaprekar. 6174 is the number, which is also called the Kaprekar
                    Constant.
